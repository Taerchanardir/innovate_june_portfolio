Random deleted comments, as I figured things out.

index.html ---------------------
<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./main.css".css">
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -->

    Using this, when there is a script in index.html, but not in page1.html etc,
     where there is a script call in index.html's <body> but not in page1.html, seems wrong and it getting very messy quickly
    There probably is a correct way to do it, but after just 1 day on Flask, I don't know that way.
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %} -->

<!-- Sticking this bit half way through the header looks untidy, is it the correct way? -->

    <!-- <script src="./app.js"></script> -->

<!-- This script only goes on this page, how do I include it on only this page but still do the changed path that base.html does?,  -->

    <!-- <title>JavaScript Events</title> -->
<!-- </head> -->
<!-- <body onload="checkCookies()"> --> -->


<!-- </body>
</html> -->


base.html -------------------

<!-- solution to index.html having javascript ans page1.html not....do include the script src etc in the boilerplate, page1.thml etc just won't call any script functions...-->

  <!-- <h1>Backend Project</h1> -->
  <!-- having a half-header is obviously broken, it means all the other page1 etc will have to have a second half of a header -->



<!-- I cannot see how this base.html can be extended into index.html, because index.html has <body onload="checkCookies()">
  can I change my body tag to match?
Yes, this works (although I can't test if checkCookies actually is working). The style started working too)
The title has been changed to the title in base.html header, which is wrong for index.html

None of the scripts are working, need to change a path somewhere...

  <!-- <script src="./app.js"></script> -->

  <!-- <script src="./app.js"></script> -->
  <!-- This is returning the 404.html, which obviously doesn't work -->

    <!-- <nav style="link: #fff;"> nope -->
    <!-- color is not working here, even though it is appearing in the 'view source' for the page-->
